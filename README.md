<h3>contactingChains.csv</h3>
This comma separated file provides for each entry the complex name, the list of protein chains ID(s) and the number and length of these chains, the chain
ID(s) short peptidic chains (i.e. chains with less than 50 amino acids and different from the peptide ligand) their number and length
